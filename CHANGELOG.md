# Changelog

All notable changes to the LLM Guidelines for SE will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) (`YYYY.MM`).

## [2026.04]

This release incorporates feedback from the community session at ICSE 2026 in Rio de Janeiro.

### Added

- **Scope:** Defined *paper* (the manuscript PDF, including any bound appendices) and *supplementary material* (anything external). When a guideline does not specify a reporting location, either is acceptable.
- **G3:** Authors SHOULD open-source their implementation.
- **G4:** New *Runtime Traces* reporting concept covering tool calls and configured-artifact activations (skills, context files, sub-agents), alongside the existing interaction-logs reporting.

### Changed

- **Guidelines order:** *Use Suitable Baselines, Benchmarks, and Metrics* moved above *Use Human Validation for LLM Outputs*. Evaluation guidelines now flow benchmarks → open-LLM baseline → human validation. The promoted guideline is now G5; *Use Human Validation* is now G7; *Use an Open LLM as a Baseline* keeps G6. Section anchors and macro names are unchanged.
- **G3 / G4:** Split and renamed. G3 *Report System and Prompt Design* (was *Report Tool Architecture Beyond Models*) covers files, schemas, skill and tool definitions. G4 *Report Session Traces* (was *Report Prompts, their Development, and Interaction Logs*) covers runtime traces. Several G3 items moved from MUST to SHOULD; G3 subheadings were reordered, with two renamed to *Agentic Systems and Pipelines* and *RAG and Ensembles*.
- **G7 (Human Validation):** Rationale and Recommendations now pick up directly from G5: where no benchmark adequately operationalizes the target construct, validate against human judgment. The *LLMs for Tools* (S6) clause is now an explicit SHOULD.
- **G2:** Treating temperature 0 as a reproducibility guarantee is now SHOULD NOT. Prompts and interaction logs cross-reference G3 and G4 instead of being restated.
- **G1:** Added a contemporary example declaration alongside the existing Llama 2 quote.
- **Throughout:** Tightened prose and elevated several plain "should" / "should not" instances to SHOULD / SHOULD NOT.
- **Tables:** Applicability matrix, reporting checklist, and rationale-recommendations table reconciled with the current guideline bodies.
- **Citations:** Standardized the convention for citing gray literature.

## [2026.03]
